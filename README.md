##What is X39s Template-Replace (short XTR)
XTR is a little application i wrote to create multiple files which differ just slightly from templates

It supports multiple template files and multiple replacement targets

##Why you did not used tool-XYZ for this?
Well ... the real reason? I did not searched and was somewhat bored ... thus this is more a project created because i wanted something to do
